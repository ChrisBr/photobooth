# Photobooth

This application is supposed to run on a linux machine which is connected to a gphoto supported camera.
I've build it to run on a raspberry pi 2 with openSUSE, connected to a Nikon D60 camera.

The Angular.js frontend uses a Rails server on the backend to trigger and process the pictures.
As this is a webserver, any tablet with a web-browser will work as a screen.
